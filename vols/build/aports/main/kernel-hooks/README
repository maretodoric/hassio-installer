Executable scripts found in this directory are executed by the kernel-hooks
package trigger after any kernel package or package providing kernel modules
is (re)installed, upgraded or removed.

Scripts are executed sequentially in alphabetic order with the following
arguments: <kernel-flavor> <new-version> [<old-version>].

<*-version> is a version of kernel package in the same format as in 'uname -r',
without the flavor (e.g. 5.10.51-0).

<new-version> is empty string if the kernel is removed.
<old-version> is empty string if the kernel is (re)installed or any package
providing modules for this kernel is installed, upgraded or removed.
