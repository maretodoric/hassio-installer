# Configuration file for radsecproxy(8).
# Refer to man page radsecproxy.conf(5) or example config with all options
# /usr/share/doc/radsecproxy/radsecproxy.conf-example.

## Global options

# Log to syslog. LOG_DAEMON used if facility not specified. The supported
# facilities are LOG_DAEMON, LOG_MAIL, LOG_USER and LOG_LOCAL0 ... LOG_LOCAL7.
LogDestination x-syslog:///

# Optional log level. 3 is default, 1 is less, 5 is more
#LogLevel 3

# Enable simple loop prevention. Note that this directive can be used in server
# blocks too, overriding what's set here in the basic settings.
#LoopPrevention on

# Add TTL attribute with value 20 if not present (prevents endless loops)
#AddTTL 20

# If we have TLS clients or servers we must define at least one tls block.
# The simplest configuration you can do is:
#tls default {
	# You must specify at least one of CACertificateFile or CACertificatePath
	# for TLS to work. We always verify peer certificate (client and server)
	#CACertificatePath /etc/ssl/certs

	# You must specify the below for TLS, we always present our certificate
	#CertificateFile /etc/ssl/radsecproxy/host.example.com.crt
	#CertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/radsecproxy/host.example.com.key
#}
