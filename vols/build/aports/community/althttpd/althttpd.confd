#** Command-line Options:
#**
#**  --root DIR       Defines the directory that contains the various
#**                   $HOST.website subdirectories, each containing web content 
#**                   for a single virtual host.  If launched as root and if
#**                   "--user USER" also appears on the command-line and if
#**                   "--jail 0" is omitted, then the process runs in a chroot
#**                   jail rooted at this directory and under the userid USER.
#**                   This option is required for xinetd launch but defaults
#**                   to "." for a stand-alone web server.
#**
#**  --port N         Run in standalone mode listening on TCP port N, or from
#**  --port N1..N2    the first available TCP port in the range from N1 to N2.
#**
#**  --user USER      Define the user under which the process should run if
#**                   originally launched as root.  This process will refuse to
#**                   run as root (for security).  If this option is omitted and
#**                   the process is launched as root, it will abort without
#**                   processing any HTTP requests.
#**
#**  --logfile FILE   Append a single-line, CSV-format, log file entry to FILE
#**                   for each HTTP request.  FILE should be a full pathname.
#**                   The FILE name is interpreted inside the chroot jail.  The
#**                   FILE name is expanded using strftime() if it contains
#**                   at least one '%' and is not too long.
#**
#**  --ipshun DIR     If the remote IP address is also the name of a file
#**                   in DIR that has size N bytes and where either N is zero
#**                   or the m-time of the file is less than N time-units ago
#**                   then that IP address is being shunned and no requests
#**                   are processed.  The time-unit is a compile-time option
#**                   (BANISH_TIME) that defaults to 300 seconds.  If this
#**                   happens, the client gets a 503 Service Unavailable
#**                   reply. Furthermore, althttpd will create ip-shunning
#**                   files following a 404 Not Found error if the request
#**                   URI is an obvious hack attempt.
#**
#**  --https BOOLEAN  Indicates that input is coming over SSL and is being
#**                   decoded upstream, perhaps by stunnel. This option
#**                   does *not* activate built-in TLS support.  Use --cert
#**                   for that.
#**
#**  --page NAME      Come up in stand-alone mode, and then try to launch a
#**                   web-browser pointing to the NAME document after the
#**                   listening socket has been created.  This option
#**                   implies --loopback and "--port 8080..8100".
#**
#**  --loopback       Only accept loop-back TCP connections (connections
#**                   originating from the same host).  This is the
#**                   default if --root is omitted.
#**
#**  --family ipv4    Only accept input from IPV4 or IPV6, respectively.
#**  --family ipv6    These options are only meaningful if althttpd is run
#**                   as a stand-alone server.
#**
#**  --jail BOOLEAN   Indicates whether or not to form a chroot jail if 
#**                   initially run as root.  The default is true, so the only
#**                   useful variant of this option is "--jail 0" which prevents
#**                   the formation of the chroot jail.
#**
#**  --max-age SEC    The value for "Cache-Control: max-age=%d".  Defaults to
#**                   120 seconds.
#**
#**  --max-cpu SEC    Maximum number of seconds of CPU time allowed per
#**                   HTTP connection.  Default 30 (build option:
#**                   -DMAX_CPU=integer). 0 means no limit.
#**
#**  --debug          Disables input timeouts.  This is useful for debugging
#**                   when inputs are being typed in manually.
#**
#** Additional command-line options available when compiling with ENABLE_TLS:
#**
#**  --cert FILE      The TLS certificate, the "fullchain.pem" file
#**
#**  --pkey FILE      The TLS private key, the "privkey.pem" file.  May be
#**                   omitted if the --cert file is the concatenation of
#**                   the fullchain.pem and the privkey.pem.
#**
#**
#** Command-line options can take either one or two initial "-" characters.
#** So "--debug" and "-debug" mean the same thing, for example.
