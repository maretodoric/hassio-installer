Subject: [PATCH] Remove '--retry-connrefused' for Busybox wget compatibility

The '--retry-connrefused' option was added to fix an issue with search.cpan.org
in 2010 (https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/issues/15). Now, more than a
decade later, the original search.cpan.org has shut down, and currently
redirects to metacpan.org. MetaCPAN does not use the old search.cpan.org method
of redirecting to a random mirror (which is what caused the original issue),
but instead relies on Fastly (https://metacpan.org/about/sponsors) for CDN
services. This makes the connection to MetaCPAN much more reliable, and the
problem of redirecting to faulty mirrors is now no longer encountered.

Additionally, when Curl added a '--retry-connrefused' option in 2016
(https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1064), the Curl backend in cpanminus
was not updated to add this option, which is further proof that the
original redirection to faulty mirrors problem has been solved.

According to the cpanminus manpage, the backends are tried in order of
LWP (perl-libwww in Alpine repos), Wget, Curl, and HTTP::Tiny (which
comes with Perl). If you have perl-libwww, then this problem with Busybox
wget will not be encountered (unless you use HTTPS, in that case you will
need perl-lwp-protocol-https too, otherwise cpanminus will still go on to
try Wget). This problem could be solved by adding GNU wget to
perl-app-cpanminus depends, but the whole point of cpanminus is to have
a CPAN client with few dependencies.

Since Busybox comes with Alpine, and Busybox wget now works when the
'--retry-connrefused' option is removed, I have taken this approach.
