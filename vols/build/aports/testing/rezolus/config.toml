# This is a minimal configuration for Rezolus that enables only universally
# usable samplers without any detailed configuration.
# See /usr/share/doc/rezolut/full-config.toml for full example.
#
# NOTE: Rezolus on Alpine Linux is built without NTP sampler (incompatible)
#  and HTTP sampler (too big; open issue on alpine/aports if you need it).

# General configuration
[general]
# Sets the socket address for Rezolus to listen on. This is a required parameter
listen = "0.0.0.0:4242"

# Specify the logging level: error, info, debug, trace,
# logging = "info"

# The default interval, in milliseconds, for all samplers
# interval = 1000

# The default window for percentiles in seconds. Samples older than this will
# age-out of the histograms.
# window = 60

# The number of worker threads which are used to run samplers.
# threads = 1
