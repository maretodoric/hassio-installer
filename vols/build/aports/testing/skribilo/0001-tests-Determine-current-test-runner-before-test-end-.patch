Subject: [PATCH] tests: Determine current test runner before test-end is
 called
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

According to SRFI 64 test-end will remove the test-runner installed by
the matching test-begin. As such, it seems that test-runner-current will
return #f, if called after test-end. Since all skribilo test cases call
test-runner-current after test-end, the following exception is currently
thrown:

	Backtrace:
	In ice-9/boot-9.scm:
	  1752:10  6 (with-exception-handler _ _ #:unwind? _ # _)
	In unknown file:
		   5 (apply-smob/0 #<thunk 7fe66b7d4ee0>)
	In ice-9/boot-9.scm:
	    724:2  4 (call-with-prompt _ _ #<procedure default-prompt-handleâ€¦>)
	In ice-9/eval.scm:
	    619:8  3 (_ #(#(#<directory (guile-user) 7fe66b7cec80>)))
	In ice-9/boot-9.scm:
	   2835:4  2 (save-module-excursion _)
	  4380:12  1 (_)
	In /home/soeren/src/aports/testing/skribilo/src/skribilo-0.9.5/tests/ast.test:
	    116:9  0 (_)

Thereby always causing all tests, as executed by `make test`, to fail. I
am not too familiar with guile so it is unclear to me how the current
code ever worked. My proposed patch stores the current failure count in
a local variable before invoking test-end, thereby fixing the exception
above.

While at it, I also replaced the test-runner-current procedure with
test-runner-get since the latter throws an exception if the test runner
isn't set (making similar issues easier to debug in the future).
Furthermore, I replaced the comparison with zero with the zero?
predicate for readability.
